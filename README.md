# Weather app Project
## THIS APP IS SUPPOSED TO BE VIEWED ON MOBILE, ON PC IT WILL NOT LOOK AS GOOD (but it will still function)

## Resources:
UI: [Figma Design by Capi Product](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1301388667663240529/weather-app-glassmorphism-design-style)
API: [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com)
Framework: [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Goals:
- [x] Be able to fetch data from an API 
- [x] Display said data in a component
- [x] Try to make it look as much like the figma example as possible
- [x] Keep it clean and do not use unnecessary packages
- [ ] Finish within 1 week.

## Things that I learned
- Usage of API's with React.
- When to apply an Interface.
- When to apply ReactFC and when not to.
- How to create a glassmorphism effect using Tailwind

## Things I could've done better
- Optimization by using components for the seperate elements instead of using just the page.tsx where I made everything.
- Better research before choosing an API
- Better research before choosing a design

## Closing thoughts on the creation of this project.
Although this project isn't 100% finished yet I have succeeded in finishing the main page which displays all of the info.
One of the core issues I encountered with this app was the design, most of the content was quite easy to find. Others like the icons used as background and to display the next hours / days were unavailable and so I had to get creative
This wasn't too much of an issue as I was still able to completely finish up the app. I am not happy that it isn't a 100% replica and will take this with me to the next project to make sure I can get all of the available assets.
I also encountered a lot of things I had to learn regarding API fetching. This was a somewhat new concept to me within javascript / react so this took quite a bit of research but I ended up being able to figure it out. And once I did and had a working json that I could fetch and use, it became a walk in the park.
